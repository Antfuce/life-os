- Changed: Completed a 360° MVP readiness/red-team audit based on current backlog, architecture, status docs, and executable checks.
- Next: Resolve merge-conflict artifacts in backend/test files, then finish P0 LiveKit bridge + event schema/recovery tasks in canonical order.
- Risks: Current repo state includes syntax-breaking conflict markers that block lint/tests and hide real reliability/security regressions.
